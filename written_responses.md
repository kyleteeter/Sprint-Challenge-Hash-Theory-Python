1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?
    Regular expressions are essentially code that is used to find patterns in text or stings of code. These can be exact matches as in "dog == dog" or they can match a set of rules like copying all text found after http: and before ' or ". The way that this works is that the regular expression sets up strict rules that can not be broken. These rules are often representate by different symbols and can be combined to make very strict rules to capture specific sections or more open that capture various matches.

2. What is an array and how does it work?
    An array is a container for related elements that has a distinct end and beginning. All items stored in this container are indexed and can be reach very quickly. Being a linear data structure arrays do a great job of organizing data in a "list" type formate. Each element in the array can be traversed using a loop and overridden or updated as needed.

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?
    Hash tables are data structures that store key value pairs. This works off of something like an associated array formate in which items can be paired together. Hash tables, like arrays, can also be modified and adjusted accourding to the needs. Collisions can be resolve and values replaced. This data structure is very usefull and rather widely used.
